Final results for sporting events are classified as those results announced at the set point of event closing.<br>
                            Those COINS collected by a User by means of Platform services will accumulate in their RUNNERBOT account. Gold coins can be redeemed in exchange for those products or services detailed in the catalogue.</p>

Requests for redemption of RUNNERBOT COINS will be fulfilled with products and/or services as detailed in the catalogue or on the mobile website.<br>
                                "Catalogue" is understood as the RAPIDO catalogue: a compiled collection of products and/or services made available to Platform users, which can only be acquired through the redemption of GOLD COINS accumulated in a RUNNERBOT account. Catalogues and their related products and/or services will be deemed expired once redeemed or in accordance with their established exposure time. Once a product or service has expired or has been removed from the catalogue, they will not be available for redemption by users.<br>
                                Each product and/or service in the RUNNERBOT catalogue has an equivalent RUNNERBOT GOLD COIN value (valuation determined by RUNNERBOT) which serves as the value for redemption.</p>

                                <p class="text thin">The redemption of products from the RAPIDO Catalogue can only be processed by means of the mobile website: www.RUNNERBOT.com. The RAPIDO Catalogue is comprised of two types of product, tangible products with deferred delivery, and services. Additionally, the aforementioned RUNNERBOT Catalogue is updated in accordance with the availability and exchange of offered prizes.<br>
                                    Tangible products with deferred delivery are understood to be those products which, once redeemed through the website, are sent to or collected by the user within 10 to 30 days from the point of exchange (in the event of collections, RUNNERBOT will confirm supplier location). It is the user’s responsibility to ensure the delivery address is correct.<br>
                                    Services are classed as intangible products, and suppose the carrying out of an activity by the user. Once redeemed, the user will be contacted by RUNNERBOT or the service provider (on behalf of RUNNERBOT) for the purposes of acceptance of the terms of use and the processing of the aforementioned withdrawal. In the event that said conditions are not accepted, the user will be denied access to the prize in question, and they will be offered one chance to exchange said prize. These services or activities must be realised by the RUNNERBOT user at all times. By nature, some products or services may be carried out with a companion, designated by the RUNNERBOT user, providing this information is communicated at the point of condition acceptance and withdrawal.<br>
                                    Products and/or services from the RUNNERBOT Catalogue may in no event be subjected to changes, alterations, compensations or cession at RUNNERBOT user requests. RUNNERBOT reserves the right to substitute products from the RUNNERBOT Catalogue with similar products at any point. Said products will be subject to the same terms and conditions defined herein, and will entail no extra cost such as direct or indirect taxes. In the event that products or services incur direct taxes, statutory regulations will apply.<br>
                                    Prizes can only be redeemed using GOLD COINS. Prize redemption is also dependant on a user’s Life mode status, as detailed in the following section.</p>

                                    <p class="text thin">The matrix is built in such a way that users must remain active on the platform, a crucial factor as prize levels are restricted by mode status. Each mode has different requirements which must be fulfilled in order to remain active on the platform. The fulfillment of said requirements also enables user progression throughout the various modes.<br>
                                        Further to registration, a user is automatically allocated an “Amateur” status, the Platform’s base mode. Life mode maintenance conditions apply to both Star and Legend Life modes. Failure to meet said maintenance levels will result in a status downgrade i.e. Legend is downgraded to Star, Star is downgraded to Pro. The aforementioned maintenance conditions do not apply to Amateur or Pro Life mode statuses.<br>
                                        The change of a user's mode will be notified instantly by means of auto-banners and on-screen notifications.<br>
                                        Once a user has been downgraded he will have the possibility to upgrade to the next status by meeting the set requirements.<br>
                                        The redemption of products and/or services must be processed in compliance with the terms and requirements established for each product/service in the Catalogue.<br>
